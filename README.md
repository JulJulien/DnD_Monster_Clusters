# DnD_Monster_Clusters

This project took a Kaggle Dataset of 700 D&D Monsters. Monster statistics were drawn from the Monster Manual, and other official D&D books. 
The goal of this project is to utilize Sparks API along with K-Means clustering to discover patterns in monster design. 
Cluster amount was decided with the assistance of an elbow plot, which identified 5 clusters as the opimal explanations of varience.
